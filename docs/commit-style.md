# Commit style

This project uses the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize the commit messages. This specification is simple and easy to follow, and it helps to create a clear history of the project.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

The commit message should also contain the number. For example, if the branch is `feature/123`, the commit message should be:

```
<type>[optional scope]: #123 <description>
```
